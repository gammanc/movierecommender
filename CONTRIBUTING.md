# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

- If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
- If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hardwork) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.

**IMPORTANT:** By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.

### Submitting changes

- Fork Movie Recommender
- Prepare necessary changes
- Add tests for your changes to `tests/`. You can skip this step if the effort to create tests for your change is unreasonable. Changes without tests are still going to be considered by us.
- Run tests and make sure all of them pass.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.
- We will review your pull request as soon as possible. Thank you for contributing!
